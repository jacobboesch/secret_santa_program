# secret_santa_program

This program is designed to select people for gift giving this christmas. 

The rules are as follows:
1. Family members in the same household can't get each other as secret santa
2. You can't get yourself as a secret santa. 
3. All family members are emailed the name of the person they are shopping for. 

I've made this program a REST API, just incase I wanted to make 
a front end for it in the future. 

Required Environment Variables:
SECRET_SANTA_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
